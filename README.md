research group.

### Customer Churn (IN PROGRESS)
Customer churn is a measure of how many users of a product will stop being customers. This [project](https://github.com/nathanstefanik/MachineLearning/tree/main/churn) uses a decision tree to predict if a customer will churn after a year using the [Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).
